# Discrete Event Simulation: Banking System
This project models a banking environment using a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) engine implemented in C++.

## Technical Highlights
- **Custom Template Data Structures:** Implemented generic Singly Linked Lists, Queues, and Sorted Doubly Linked Lists from scratch.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Managed system state transitions using a time-ordered Event Queue.
- **Load Balancing:** Developed a `MultipleQueue` manager to route customers based on real-time queue occupancy.
- **Memory Safety:** Enforced manual memory management and deep-copy semantics to prevent leaks and ensure stability.

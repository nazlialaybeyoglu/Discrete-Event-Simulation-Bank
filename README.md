Discrete Event Simulation: Banking System

This project implements a complete Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to model bank operations. It focuses on efficient data management, load balancing, and manual memory management in C++.

Key Features

Custom Data Structures: Implemented Singly and Sorted Doubly Linked Lists from scratch using C++ Templates.

Simulation Logic: Handles various event types (Arrival, Dispatch, Service) using a time-ordered Event Queue .

Load Balancing: Utilizes a MultipleQueue manager to route customers to the shortest waiting line.

Memory Management: Implemented deep-copy semantics (Copy Constructors, Assignment Operators) and manual deallocation to ensure no memory leaks .
